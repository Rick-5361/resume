    <li>I like to learn new things. Lately I've been really interested in tinkering with web development and learning javascript.</li>
    <li>Cooking is not my greatest strength, which can be attested by my girlfriend, but I do enjoy experimenting in the kitchen.</li>
    <li>Playing video games, I've lead men and women into the trenches of "Hell Let Loose", survived the fallout in "Fallout 4", and went on a roller coaster of emotions completing "The Last of Us", a game I feel had one of the 
        best storys ever to come to this medium.
